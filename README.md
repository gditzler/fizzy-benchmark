===============

This repo contains a few scripts to benchmark the Fizzy feature selection module. We are using the [EESI build of QIIME]{http://github.com/EESI/FizzyQIIME} and the Metahit data set. I am NOT going to upload the data required to run the code. Either download the data and put it in the BIOM format, or email me (gregory.ditzler@gmail.com).
